\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame. If it is a matrix, it gets turned into a data frame.}

\item{format}{Either "pdf", "html" or "word".}

\item{digits, row.names, escape, align, font_size, full_width, longtable, booktabs, bootstrap_options, caption}{Passed through (or not)
to kable or flextable, or not at all. They're named arguments because
passing them through as dots causes errors because \code{kable} and
\code{flextable} allow different things in via the dots.}

Create a table, depending on the type of output format
}
\details{
It kind of works for html and pdf, not really tested for Word. It
  is very limited in terms of the options available.
